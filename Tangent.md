# Definition
## Tangent
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional [[Submanifold|submanifold]] of $\mathbb{R}^{n + k}, m \in M$ and $v \in \mathbb{R}^{n + k};$ $v$ is said to be _tangent_ to $M$ at $m$ if there exists a [[Path#Path|curve]] $c : I \to M$ on the [[Submanifold|submanifold]] in $\mathbb{R}^{n + k}$ such that $c(0) = m$ and $c'(0) = v.$
### Remark
The [[Vector|vector]] $v$ is called the [[Tangent Vector#Tangent Vector|tangent vector]].
