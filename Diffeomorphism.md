# Definition
## Diffeomorphism
Given two [[Manifold#Manifold|manifolds]] $M$ and $N,$ a [[Differentiable Map#Differentiable Map|differentiable map]] $f : M \to N$ is called a *diffeomorphism* if it is a [[Bijection|bijection]] and its [[Inverse Function#Inverse Function|inverse]] $f^{-1} : N \to M$ is differentiable as well.
### Remark
If these functions are $r$ times [[Continuity#Continuous|continuously]] [[Differentiable#Differentiable on a Subset|differentiable]], $f$ is called a $C^r$-diffeomorphism
## Diffeomorphic
Two [[Manifold#Manifold|manifolds]] $M$ and $N$ are *diffeomorphic* (usually denoted $M \simeq N$) if there is a [[Diffeomorphism#Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism]] between them. 
### Remark
They are $C^r$-diffeomorphic if there is an $r$ times continuously differentiable bijective map between them whose inverse is also $r$ times continuously differentiable.
