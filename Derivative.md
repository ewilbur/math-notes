# Definition
## Derivative
Let $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ be [[Differentiable#Differentiable at a Point|differentiable]] at $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ with $\lambda : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ taken to be the [[Linear Map|linear transformation]] such that
$$
	\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|f(a + h) - f(a) - \lambda(h)|}{h} = 0.
$$
Then $\lambda$ is called the *derivative* of $f$ at $a$ and denoted $Df(a).$
