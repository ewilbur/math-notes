## Covering Map
Let $M$ and $\tilde{M}$ be two [[Manifold|manifolds]]. A map $p : \tilde{M} \to M$ is a *covering map* if
1. $p$ is [[Smoothness|smooth]] and [[Surjectivity|surjective]]
2. for any $m \in M,$ there exists a [[Neighborhood#Neighborhood|neighborhood]] $U$ of $m$ in $M$ with $p^{-1}(U)=\cup_{j \in J}U_j,$ where the $U_j$ are disjoint open subsets of $\tilde{M}$ such that, for $j \in J, p : U_j \to U$ is a [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism]].
