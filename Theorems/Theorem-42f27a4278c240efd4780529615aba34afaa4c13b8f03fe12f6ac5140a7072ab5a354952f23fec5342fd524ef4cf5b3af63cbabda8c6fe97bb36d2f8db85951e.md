# Theorem
If $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$ is [[Differentiable#Differentiable at a Point|differentiable]] at $a,$ and $g : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^p$ is [[Differentiable#Differentiable at a Point|differentiable]] at $f(a),$ then the composition $g \circ f$ is [[Differentiable#Differentiable at a Point|differentiable]] at $a,$ and
$$
	(g \circ f)'(a) = g'(f(a))\cdot f'(a).
$$
