# Theorem
Let $X = A \cup B,$ where $A$ and $B$ are [[Closed|closed]] in $X.$ Let $f : A \to Y$ and $g : B \to Y$ be [[Continuity#Continuous|continuous]]. If $f(x) = g(x)$ for every $x \in A \cap B,$ then $f$ and $g$ combine to give a continuous function $h : X \to Y,$ defined by setting
$$
	h(x) = \begin{cases}
		f(x) & \text{if } x \in A, \\
		g(x) & \text{if } x \in B.
	\end{cases}
$$
## Proof
Let $C$ be a closed subset of $Y.$ Now $$h^{-1}(C) = f^{-1}(C) \cup g^{-1}(C),$$ by elementary set theory. Since $f$ is continuous, $f^{-1}(C) is closed in $A$ and, therefore, [[Closed|closed]] in $X.$ Similarly, $g^{-1}(C)$ is closed in $B$ and therefore closed in $X.$ Their union $h^{-1}(C)$ is thus closed in $X.$
