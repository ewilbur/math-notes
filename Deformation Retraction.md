## Definition
A _deformation retraction_ of a space $X$ onto a subspace $A \subseteq X$ is a family of maps $f_t : X \to X, t \in I,$ such that $f_0 = \mathbb{1}$ (the identity map), $f_1(X) = A,$ and $f_t|_A = \mathbb{1}$ for all $t \in I$. The family $f_t$ should be [[Continuity|continuous]] in the sense that the associated map $X \times I \to X, (x, t) \mapsto f_t(x),$ is [[Continuity|continuous]].

### Remarks
A deformation retraction of $X$ onto a subspace $A \subseteq X$ can be seen as a [[Homotopy|homotopy]] from the identity map of $X$ to a [[Retraction|retraction]] of $X$ onto $A$.  

### Examples
- Deformation retractions of a disk with two holes ![[Pasted image 20230910153236.png]]
- Any topological space trivially deformation retracts to itself.
