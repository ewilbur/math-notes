## Base
Given a [[Topological Space#Topological space|topological space]] $(X, \tau)$, a *base* for the [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] $\tau$ (also called a *base for $X$* if the [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] is understood) is a [[Family (Set)|family]] $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \tau$  such that
1. for each $x \in X,$ there is at least one base element $B \in \mathcal{B}$ containing $x,$
2. if $x$ belongs to the intersection of two base elements $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal{B},$ then there is a base element $B_3 \in B$ containing $x$ such that $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2.$
