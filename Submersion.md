## Submersion at a Point
Let $M$ and $N$ be [[Differentiable Manifold|differentiable manifolds]] and $f : M \to N$ be a [[Differentiable Map|differentiable map]] between them. The map $f$ is a *submersion at a point* $p \in M$ if its [[Differential|differential]] $$Df_p : T_pM \to T_{f(p)}N$$ is a [[Surjectivity|surjective]] [[Linear Map|linear map]].
## Submersion
A [[Differentiable Map|differentiable map]] $f$ that is a [[Submersion#Submersion at a Point|submersion at each point]] $p \in M$ is called a *submersion*.
