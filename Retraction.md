## Definition
A map $r : X \to X$ is a _retraction of $X$ onto $A$_ if $r(X)=A$ and $r|_A = \mathbb{1}$. 

### Remark
One could also view a retraction as a map $r : X \to X$ with $r \circ r = r.$ In this sense, retractions are the topological analogs of [[Projection|projection]] operators in other parts of mathematics .
