# Definition
## Coarse Topology
Let $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ be two [[Topological Space#Topology|topologies]] on a set $X$ such that $\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2.$ Then the [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] $\tau_1$ is said to be *coarser* [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] than $\tau_2.$
### Remark
- The [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] $\tau_1$ can also be referred to as being *weaker* or *smaller* [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] than $\tau_2.$
- If $\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$ then $\tau_1$ is *strictly coarser (weaker or smaller)* than $\tau_2.$ 
## Fine Topology
Let $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ be two [[Topological Space#Topology|topologies]] on a set $X$ such that $\tau_2 \subseteq \tau_1.$ Then the [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] $\tau_1$ is said to be *finer* [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] than $\tau_2.$
### Remark
- The [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] $\tau_1$ can also be referred to as being *stronger* or *larger* [[Topological Space#Topology|topology]] than $\tau_2.$
- If $\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$ then $\tau_1$ is *strictly finer (stronger or larger)* than $\tau_2.$
