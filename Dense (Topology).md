# Definition
## Dense
Suppose $X$ is a [[Topological Space#Topological space|space]], $S \subseteq X.$ Then $S$ is said to be *dense in $X$* if $\bar{S} = X.$
### Remark
- $\bar{S}$ is the [[Closure (Topology)#Closure|closure]] of $S$ 
- Equivalently, if every nonempty [[Open Set#Open Set|open]] [[Subset#Subset|subset]] of $X$ contains at least one point of $S.$
## Nowhere Dense
Suppose $X$ is a [[Topological Space#Topological space|space]], $S \subseteq X.$ Then $S$ is said to be *nowhere dense in $X$* if $\bar{S}$ contains no nonempty [[Open Set#Open Set|open]] [[Subset#Subset|subset]].  
### Remark
- $\bar{S}$ is the [[Closure (Topology)#Closure|closure]] of $S$
