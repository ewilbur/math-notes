# Definition
## Path
Given points $x$ and $y$ of the space $X$, a _path_ in $X$ from $x$ to $y$ is a [[Continuity#Continuous|continuous]] map $f : [a, b] \to X$ of some closed interval in the real line into $X$, such that $f(a) = x$ and $f(b) = y.$
### Remark
- One can define a well-defined [[Path Product|product]] on the [[Equivalence Relation#Equivalence Class|equivalence classes]] of [[Path#Path|paths]] to create a [[Groupoid|groupoid]].
