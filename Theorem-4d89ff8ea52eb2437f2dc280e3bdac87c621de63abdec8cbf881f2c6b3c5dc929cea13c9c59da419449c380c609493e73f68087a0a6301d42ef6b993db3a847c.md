# Theorem
The [[Path Product#Path Product|path product]] $*$ has the following properties
1. **Associativity**: If $[f] * ([g]*[h])$ is defined, so is $([f] *[g])*[h]$ and $$[f] * ([g]*[h]) = ([f] *[g])*[h].$$
2. **Right and left identities**: Given $x \in X,$ let $e_x$ decone the constant path $e_x : I \to X$ carrying all of $I$ to the point $x.$ If $f$ is a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1,$ then $$ \begin{align}[f] * [e_{x_1}] = [f] && \text{and} && [e_{x_0}]*[f]=[f]\end{align}.$$
3. **Inverse**: Given the path $f$ in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1,$ let $\bar{f}$ be the path defined by $\bar{f}(s) = f(1 - s).$ It is called the [[Reverse Path| reverse]] of $f.$ Then $$ \begin{align}[f] * [\bar{f}] = [e_{x_0}] && \text{and} && [\bar{f}] * [f] = [e_{x_1}]\end{align}.$$
