## Group
A _group_ is a non-empty set $G$ together with a [[Binary Operation|binary operation]] on $G,$ here denoted "$\cdot$", such that the following three requirements are satisfied
1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b$ in $G,$ one has $(a \cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
2. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that, for every $a \in G,$ one has $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a.$
3. **Inverse element**: For each $a \in G,$ there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a \cdot b = e = b \cdot a.$
