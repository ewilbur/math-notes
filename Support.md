## Support
 If $f$ is any real-valued or vector-valued function on a [[Topological Space#Topological space|topological space]] $M$, the *support* of $f,$ denoted by $\text{supp }f,$ is the [[Closure (Topology)#Closure|closure]] of the set of points where $f$ is nonzero: $$\text{supp } f = \overline{\left\{p \in M : f(p) \neq 0\right\}}.$$
## Support in U
If the [[Support#Support|support]] is contained in some set $U,$ then we say that $f
