# Definition
## [[Locally Euclidean#Locally Euclidean|Locally Euclidean]] of Dimension $n$
A space $M$ is *locally Euclidean of dimension $n$* if each point of $M$ has a [[Neighborhood#Neighborhood|neighborhood]] that is [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an [[Open Set#Open Set|open]] subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$
### Remark
- Equivalently, $M$ has an [[Atlas#Atlas|atlas]] $\mathcal{A}$ and for all [[Chart#Chart|charts]] $(U, \psi) \in \mathcal{A}, \psi : M \to \mathbb{R}^n.$ ^f4ef72
	- Since all [[Chart#Chart|charts]] have the same [[Domain|domain]] and [[Codomain|codomain]], saying the [[Locally Euclidian of Dimension n#^f4ef72|above statement]] is true for all [[Chart#Chart|charts]] is redundant.
