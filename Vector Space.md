## Vector Space
A *vector space* over a [[Field|field]] $F$ is a non-empty [[Set|set]] $V$ together with two [[Binary Operation|binary operations]]:
1. **vector addition**: The first operation, called **vector addition** assigns any two [[Vector#Vector|vectors]] $v, w \in V$ a third [[Vector#Vector|vector]] in $V$ which is commonly written as $v + w,$ and called the *sum* of these two vectors
2. **scalar multiplication**: The second operation, called scalar multiplication, assigns to any scalar $a \in F$ and any vector $v \in V$ another vector in $V,$ which is denoted $av.$
To have a vector space, the eight following axioms must be satisfied for every $u, v,$ and $w$ in $V,$ and $a$ and $b$ in $F:$
1. **associativity of vector addition**
2. **commutativity of vector addition**
3. **identity element of vector addition**
4. **inverse elements of vector addition**
5. **compatibility of scalar multiplication with [[Field|field]] multiplication**: $a(bv) = (ab)v.$
6. **identity element of scalar multiplication**
7. **distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition**
8. **distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition**
### Remarks
- The elements of $V$ are called [[Vector#Vector|vectors]].
- The elements of $F$ are called [[Scalar|scalars]].
