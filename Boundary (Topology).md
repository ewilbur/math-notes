# Definition
## Boundary
Suppose $X$ is a [[Topological Space#Topological space|space]], $S \subseteq X.$ The *boundary of $S,$* denoted $\partial S,$ is the set of all points of $X$ that are in neither the [[Interior (Topology)#Interior|interior]] nor [[Exterior (Topology)#Exterior|exterior]] of $S.$
### Remark
$x \in \partial S \iff x \notin \text{Int }S \cup \text{Ext }S$
