# Definition
## Generated Topology
If $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{B}$ is an arbitrary [[Family (Set)|collection]] of [[Subset|subsets]] of $X$, the [[Comparison of Topologies#Coarse Topology|coarsest]]
topology $\tau$ on $X$ containing $\mathcal{B}$ is called the *topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$*.
# Theorems
## Theorem-c1c88a7c
If $X$ is any set and $\mathcal{B}$ is an arbitrary [[Family (Set)|collection]] of [[Subset|subsets]] of $X$, the topology [[Generated Topology#Generated Topology|generated]] by $\mathcal{B}$ exists and is unique.

### Remark
Because of [[Generated Topology#Theorem-c1c88a7c|Theorem-c1c88a7c]], it makes sense to refer to *the* [[Comparison of Topologies#Coarse Topology|coarsest]] topology $\tau$ on $X$  in the definition for the [[Generated Topology#Generated Topology|generated topology]].
