# Definition
## Product Topolgy
Let $\mathcal{S}_\beta$ denote the collection $$\mathcal{S}_\beta =\left\{\pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\beta) \mid U_\beta \text{ open in } X_\beta\right\},$$ and let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the union of these collections, $$\bigcup_{\beta \in J} \mathcal{S}_\beta.$$ The topology generated by the [[Base (Topology)|subbasis]] $\mathcal{S}$ is called the _product topology_. In this topology, $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ is called the _product space_.

# Remarks
The **product space** is the [[Cartesian Product|cartesian product]] of a family of topological spaces equipped with a [[Natural Topology|natural topology]] called the product topology. This topology differs from another, perhaps more natural-seeming, topology called the [box topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_topology "Box topology"), which can also be given to a product space and which [agrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_topologies "Comparison of topologies") with the product topology when the product is over only finitely many spaces. However, the product topology is "correct" in that it makes the product space a [categorical product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory) "Product (category theory)") of its factors, whereas the box topology is too [fine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_topologies "Comparison of topologies"); in that sense the product topology is the natural topology on the Cartesian product.
