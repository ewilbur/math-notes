# Definition
## Topology
A _topology_ on a [[Set|set]] $X$ is defined as a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$, called [[Topological Space#Open Set|open set]] and satisfying the following axioms:
1. The empty set and $X$ itself belong to $\tau$
2. Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.
3. The intersection of any finite number of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$

## Topological space
If $\tau$ is a topology on a [[Set|set]] $X$ then the tuple $(X, \tau)$ is a _topological space_. 
## Open Set
A set $U \subseteq X$ is an _open set_ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ if $U \in \tau$.
