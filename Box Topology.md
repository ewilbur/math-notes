Not to be confused with the [[Product Topology|product topology]], the box topology is where the basis is given by the [[Cartesian Product|cartesian product]] of open sets in the component spaces.

While the box topology has a somewhat more intuitive definition than the product topology, it satisfies fewer desirable properties. In particular, if all the component spaces are [compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space "Compact space"), the box topology on their Cartesian product will not necessarily be compact, although the product topology on their Cartesian product will always be compact. In general, the box topology is [finer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finer_topology "Finer topology") than the product topology, although the two agree in the case of [finite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/finite "wiktionary:finite") direct products (or when all but finitely many of the factors are [trivial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_topology "Trivial topology")).

## Definition
Given $X$ such that $$X := \prod_{i \in I} X_i,$$ or the (possibly infinite) [[Cartesian Product|cartesian product]] of the topological spaces $X_i$, indexed by $i \in I$, the _box topology_ on $X$ is generated by the [[Base (Topology)|base]] $$\mathcal{B}=\left\{\prod_{i \in I}U_i \mid U_i \text{ open in } X_i\right\}.$$
